# U.S._CANCER_ANALYSIS
US County Cancer Analysis


## Project Goals



## Pipeline
I have downloaded the data as .txt & .csv files, read it into my jupyter notebook, and started to parse out meaningful statistics such as the mortality and incidence rates for each race, gender, and zip code as well as the totals.

## Statistics of Interest




## UV Exposure Questions





## Visualizations





## Considerations/Issues
I'm not sure which statistic to trust: the total mortality/incidence or the addition of all of the races per county? The numbers when added are larger than the total which does not suggest that we are missing a minority group but instead suggests the numbers are tabulated differently. --> totals

How do I or can I join my UV data with my Cancer data, especially when the counties aren't making sense? It would be much better to do some correlations and statistical tests with it rather than just overlaying graphs.



What suggestions do you have for different types of visualizations? Cloropleth map? depends
